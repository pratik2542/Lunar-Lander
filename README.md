# Lunar-Lander
 This code uses DQN algorithm and TensorFlow Agents library to implement a reinforcement learning agent trained on OpenAI Gym's Lunar Lander v2 environment. It sets up the environment, defines the Q-network, initializes the DQN agent, and sets up the replay buffer for experience replay
